# DeskPi PicoMate Exploration

## Getting Up and Running

I am following [DeskPi PicoMate User Manual V1.0](https://deskpi.com/blogs/learn/deskpi-picomate-user-manual-and-sources) which lists using CircuitPython 7.3.3 for this project with DeskPi PicoMate.

For the following projects, it is assumed that steps discussed in the PicoMate are completed and `CIRCUITPY` directory is successfully mounted. 

### Project 1 - Blink RGB LED

1. Create a `lib` directory on `CIRCUITPY`.
2. Copy `neopixel.py` into that directory.
3. Copy `code.py` in `CIRCUITPY` and now head to Mu Editor, click on `Ctrl + D` to reload the program.
